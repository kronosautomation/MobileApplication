# TypeScript Migration Guide for MindfulMastery

This document outlines the migration steps taken to fully transition MindfulMastery from a mixed JavaScript/TypeScript codebase to a more consistent TypeScript implementation.

## Changes Made

1. **Entry Point Consolidation**
   - Removed `App.js` in favor of `App.tsx` (renamed to `App.js.bak` for backup)
   - Updated `index.js` to explicitly import from `App.tsx`

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Enhanced `tsconfig.json` with stricter compilation options
   - Added path aliases for cleaner imports
   - Included appropriate files in compilation scope
   - Added explicit type checking options

3. **Package.json Updates**
   - Fixed the `expo-sqlite` version inconsistency in the resolutions field
   - Added a new `typecheck` script to validate TypeScript code
   - Updated the project version and added migration notes

4. **Type Definitions**
   - Enhanced type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`
   - Added SQLite-specific types
   - Added network status types
   - Added global type declaration for Hermes
   - Improved theme type definitions

## Testing Your Setup

After pulling these changes, you should:

1. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date
2. Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript compilation is working
3. Run `npm start` to verify the app launches correctly

If you encounter TypeScript errors:
1. Check the file path if import errors occur
2. Add proper type definitions for any components with type errors
3. Refer to the updated types in `src/types/index.ts`

## Benefits of the Migration

- **Improved Type Safety**: TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocompletion and inline documentation
- **Clearer Component Interfaces**: Props and state are explicitly typed
- **Simplified Debugging**: Types make it easier to understand data structures
- **Better Codebase Navigation**: TypeScript's type system helps IDEs provide better navigation

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more specific TypeScript types for components that still use `any`
- Write more unit tests specifically testing TypeScript interfaces
- Continue refactoring individual components to follow React Native with Expo best practices
